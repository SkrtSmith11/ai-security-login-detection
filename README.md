## AI-Powered Login Threat Detection (SOC-Style Project)
## Overview
This project simulates an AI-assisted Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow
to detect suspicious login activity using machine learning and rule-based logic.

The system analyzes authentication logs, identifies anomalous behavior,
detects brute-force attacks, assigns risk levels, and exports analyst-ready reports.

## Key Features
- Synthetic authentication log generation
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Brute-force attack detection
- Risk scoring (Low / Medium / High)
- Analyst-friendly summaries and exports
- Visualization of suspicious activity

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outputs
- SOC_Incident_Details.csv
- SOC_User_Risk_Summary.csv
- SOC_Bruteforce_Alerts.csv

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates practical SOC skills such as:
- Security log analysis
- Threat detection logic
- Data enrichment
- Incident reporting
